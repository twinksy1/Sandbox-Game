ABOUT:
	This is a small sandbox game I decided to do after viewing a video in the graphics programming reddit.
	It is a work in progress that I will do during my free time. I plan on adding a variety of blocks and
	block interactions.

PROGRAM USE:
	- Left click draws single particle at mouse location(if on screen)
	- Holding left click continually draws particles
	- Right click deletes particles falling within a certain radius of the mouse
	- Holding right click continually deletes particles
	- m button displays a menu where you can click to change between the particles being drawn

DEBUGGING:
	- Holding left shift key and left clicking on the screen displays the closest cell's info
